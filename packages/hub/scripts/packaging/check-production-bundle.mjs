/**
 * Asserts the shipped plugin reads the published update feed and nothing else.
 *
 * The feed URL is substituted into the bundle when it is built, so the only way
 * a shipped plugin could read a developer's test feed is if that URL were baked
 * in. rollup.config.mjs refuses to do that outside a development build, and this
 * asserts the outcome rather than trusting the rule: the two guards fail
 * independently, and a build that slips past both would ship a plugin quietly
 * asking a stranger which version its users are behind.
 *
 * This runs from `postbuild` and nowhere else, which is what lets it assume the
 * bundle it reads is a production one. It does not check that, because it cannot:
 * inferring a build mode from an artifact is guessing, and a guess is exactly the
 * wrong thing to build a release guard on. The assumption is held up by the npm
 * script graph instead. `build` fixes SHO_METRICS_BUILD_MODE to production, and
 * rollup's cleanPluginOutput plugin empties bin/ before writing, so the file below
 * can only be the one that build just produced. `build:dev` and `watch` have no
 * postbuild, so a development bundle never reaches this at all.
 *
 * Do not add a standalone script for this. A second entry point is a second way
 * to point it at a bundle nobody promised anything about, and the failure then
 * reads as a leaked feed URL rather than as the mistake it is.
